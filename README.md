**`Game Developer & Computer Engineer`**

I'm Elijah Tanimowo from Canada, and I am a Game Developer and Computer Engineer. I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering Technology at Humber College in 2023 and decided to further pursue my studies into the field of Game Programming. I hope to learn new skills and improve my current ones as I enter the industry.
